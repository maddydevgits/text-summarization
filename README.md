# text-summarization
Official Repo of my project Text Summarization using TensorFlow, In this project, we have developed a Text Summarizer model which generates the summary from the provided review using the LSTM model and Attention Mechanism. We got an accuracy of 87.82% which is good as we have taken only 1,00,000 records for training and testing sets.
